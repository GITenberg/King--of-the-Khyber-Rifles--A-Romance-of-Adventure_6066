description: "King of the Khyber Rifles is a novel by British writer Talbot Mundy.\
  \ Captain Athelstan King is a secret agent for the British Raj at the beginning\
  \ of the First World War. Heavily influenced both by Mundy's own unsuccessful career\
  \ in India and by his interest in theosophy, it describes King's adventures among\
  \ the (mostly Muslim) tribes of the north with the mystical woman adventuress, princess\
  \ Yasmini and the Turkish mullah Muhammed Anim. Like Greenmantle by John Buchan,\
  \ also first published in 1916, it deals with the possibility that Turkey might\
  \ try to stir Muslims into a jihad against the British Empire.\nThe Khyber Rifles\
  \ was and is an actual regiment.\nWhat was to be Mundy's third novel was originally\
  \ serialised in Everybody's Magazine in nine parts from May 1916 illustrated by\
  \ Joseph Clement Coll. It was published in book form in November 1916.\nThe book\
  \ gave many characters and themes to the book The Peshawar Lancers, including the\
  \ main character, Athelstane King.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
